## Notice

XCP-ng Center is no longer EOL! We have a new maintainer (Michael Manley) to work on the current codebase and will maintain it for the foreseeable future.

Please submit any bug reports to the issue tracker. When reporting a bug make sure the following is done to make diagnostics easy for all:
* Make sure PDB's are installed. This will give more meaningful error messages on an exception in the logs.
* XCP-ng Center.log file (Default Location is %APPDATA%\XCP-ng\XCP-ng Center\logs\XCP-ng Center.log)

The next are nice to haves, but are not required for a bug report
* XCP-ng Center-AuditTrail.log (Default Location is %APPDATA%\XCP-ng\XCP-ng Center\logs\XCP-ng Center-AuditTrail.log)
* minidump.dmp (if it exists its in %APPDATA%\XCP-ng\XCP-ng Center\minidump.dmp) This file is only created on a unhandled exception, 
  and not normal errors. Its also overwritten on each unhandled exception.

## Notice on builds 25054 and up
The way settings are done has changed. If you have a previous version of XCP-ng Center installed, your configuration will not migrate over.
This is due to the new settings system that was implemented in build 25054. You will need to reconfigure your settings. This change is to
allow for a portable version of XCP-ng Center where the settings and logs will be stored in the same directory as the executable.

## Disclaimer
The official graphical client for XCP-ng is [Xen Orchestra](https://xen-orchestra.com), which gets support from a team of several developers.
XCP-ng Center is maintained by community members on their free time and hosted by the XCP-ng project.
